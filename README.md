# ATDD - WEB TEST AUTOMATION WORKSHOP

This is a 2-day interactive and predominantly hands-on technically focused course on web test automation. You will learn how test automation improves the workflow of the entire Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) development process. This course introduces cucumber.js and TypeScript, with tests running in a homogeneous development environment, as well as the techniques necessary to write tests that are robust and easy to maintain.

### TOPICS COVERED

- Leveraging scenarios to obtain a shared understanding of the acceptance criteria
- Automating and verifying acceptance tests through a browser
- Exploring techniques that helps organize your tests

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

Participants will be able to...

- Automate acceptance criteria for a website using cucumber.js, TypeScript and the Chrome web browser
- Understanding how test automation supports verifying existing functionality, bug remediation, and new feature development
- Understand testing patterns to keep tests reusable and organized

### TARGET AUDIENCE

- Quality Assurance / Test Automation (Technical)
- Engineers / Developers
- Product & Design

### PARTICIPANT REQUIREMENTS

- Recommended experience with a computer programming language

# TDD TRAINING

This 3-day course covers the fundamentals of Test Driven Development with an emphasis on learning the skills and techniques necessary to perform this discipline in the real world. Participants will begin with simple exercises and migrate to advanced techniques for building applications designed for testing, using stubs and mocks. Participants will also learn the benefits of paired programming practices. Additionally, the course will address the issues associated with working in legacy code.

### TOPICS COVERED

- The Red, Green, Refactor pattern
- Using Mocks, Stubs, Fakes, Doubles, and other testing patterns
- Building code that is testable
- How to refactor existing code to make it testable
- Test Driven Development in Angular

### LEARNING OUTCOMES

Participants will be able to...

- Appreciate the benefit of writing clean, maintainable code
- Identify the relationship between software quality and TDD
- Recognize that TDD promotes safe, rapid changes to existing code through immediate feedback
- Understand the appropriate time to use mocks and stubs
- Identify good and bad testing patterns
- Identify code smells for identifying non-testable code

Participants will become familiar with:

- Writing tests first
- Multiple paired testing techniques
- How to modify software design using a test-first approach

### TARGET AUDIENCE

- Quality Assurance / Test Automation (Technical)
- Engineers / Developers
