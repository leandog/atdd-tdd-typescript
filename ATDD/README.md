# ATDD Course Outline

- Introductions
  - Hello, World!
- How automation fits into ATDD
  - Automation is just one part of it, not the whole ATDD story
- Overview of the technologies available
- SpecFlow (.NET), Cucumber JVM (Java), Behave (Python), and Cucumber (Ruby)
- What does automation give us & how is it useful to each team member
- Review the pre-canned Puppy Site scenarios weâ€™re going to use to write the step definitions & supporting test code
- Clone the Puppies test project (not web site code) from GitHub to give us all the necessary plumbing already setup
- Iterate over exercises to illustrate automating a scenario, based on user stories, using TypeScript, Cucumber and Watir
  - Attendees write the test, based on how the Puppies page they are testing is structured
  - Attendees then run Cukes to determine success or if they need to fix things
  - Attendees will implement a new feature
