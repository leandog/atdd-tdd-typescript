# Three Laws of Test Driven Development
- You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
- You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
- You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

O - One                           
M - Many
B - Boundary Behavior
I - Interface Definition          
E - Exercise Exception Behavior

PROBLEM REQUIREMENTS:
- Numerals can be concatenated to form a larger numeral (“XX” + “II” = “XXII”)
- If a lesser numeral is put before a bigger it means subtraction of the lesser from 
    the bigger (“IV” means four, “CM” means nine hundred)
- If the numeral is I, X or C you can’t have more than three (“II” + “II” = “IV”)
- If the numeral is V, L or D you can’t have more than one (“D” + “D” = “M”)
