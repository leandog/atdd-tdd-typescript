# Three Laws of Test Driven Development
- You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
- You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
- You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

PROBLEM REQUIREMENTS:
- For the multiples of seven print “Pop”, unless it is a multiple of three or five. 

- For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number
- For the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz“.
**Upper bound**: 15
**Example output**: [1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 14, 'FizzBuzz']
