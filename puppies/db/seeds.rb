Very sweet and playful. She was dumped in a deserted area in Cleveland, one of our
volunteers stopped to feed her and she ran after the van as she drove away.  Needless
to say she was crying for help!  She was first timid and shy and now she has regained
her trust in people.  Maggie is very gentle and calm.
